# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Project 2 - Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph

See the result here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-datavis-scatterplot-graph/

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Data Visualization using D3.js library.

The data represents the various times of athletes as well as the allegations of doping made and comes from here : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json.

The project answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph with the tests that can be run from the page itself.
